CipherCloud is committed to building trust in the cloud. Our revolutionary cloud encryption gateway technology is enabling organizations worldwide to enjoy the benefits of the cloud that otherwise wouldn't be able to due to concerns about data security, privacy, residency, and regulatory compliance.
Our company was founded in 2010 by security visionary Pravin Kothari, who has started two other successful security companies, including ArcSight, which was sold to Hewlett Packard for $1.6 billion. Pravin recognized that while the cloud was experiencing explosive growth, the technologies that addressed the new security threats associated with this new model had not kept pace. Pravin national drug code 0019-9892-12 saw an opportunity to protect sensitive enterprise data across multiple clouds through a revolutionary new approach—the cloud encryption gateway. This technology allows organizations to protect their data in the cloud without sacrificing application functionality, the user experience, or performance, and without making any changes to the cloud application.
